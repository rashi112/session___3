            Introduction
          </h2>
          <p>
            In the previouse Session you have learned how loops are from thread and interlooped to prodused a fabric. You also know that there are type of needles employed fro knitting.Now we are going to study process of knittingin more detail.
            Frist of all we can look at how loop fromation is carried out by breared needles. All the elements required for knitting with breaded needles also will be described (Session 2.2).Then we will be studying knitting action of latch needles(Session2.2)and finaly how compunond needles are employed for loop fromation and interlooping.

                  <ol>1.Positioning the Yarn: The yarn is laid over the bearded needle. The needle consists of a shank (stem) and a hook with a flexible beard (a thin, curved end).<br>
                  <br>2.Pressing the Beard: As the yarn is placed over the needle's hook, the beard is pressed down by a presser bar or another mechanical device, which encloses the hook and traps the yarn inside.<br>
                 <br> 3.Raising the Needle: The needle is raised through the old loop of yarn from the previous stitch. This allows the new yarn loop to be pulled through the old loop, forming a stitch.<br>
                 <br> 4.Releasing the Yarn: Once the needle moves upward and the new loop is drawn through, the beard is released (unpressed), allowing the new loop to slip off the hook and form a stitch.<br>
                  <br>5.Completing the Loop: The needle is lowered back into position, ready for the next yarn to be laid across it and to repeat the process.</ol>
                  This process allows for efficient and fast loop formation in knitting. The bearded needle’s design provides flexibility, enabling it to handle various types of yarns and produce different stitch patterns.</p>

                        <backdrop-filter: blur(80px);><ol><br>1.Yarn Feed: The yarn is fed to the needles through a yarn guide or directly by hand in the case of hand knitting.<br>
                          <br>2.Needle Movement: The latch needle starts in its lowest position, where the old loop from the previous row rests in the needle's hook.<br>
                          <br>3.Rising Action: The needle rises, pulling the old loop over the latch and up the needle’s shaft. This allows the latch to open as the old loop passes by.<br>
                          <br>4.Yarn Capture: As the needle reaches its highest position, new yarn is introduced and caught in the hook of the needle.<br>
                          <br>5.Descent and Latch Closing: The needle then begins to descend, and the old loop slides down, causing the latch to close as it comes into contact with the old loop. The latch closes over the new yarn, trapping it inside the needle's hook.<br>
                          <br>6.New Loop Formation: As the needle continues to descend, the old loop slips off the needle and the new loop is drawn through it, forming a new stitch.<br>
                          <br>7.Reset Position: The needle returns to its lowest position, ready to repeat the cycle with the next loop.</ol><br>

<br>2.Needle Rise: The needle moves upward, and the old loop is cleared over the closing element, which remains closed during this phase.
<br>3.Yarn Feed: As the needle reaches its maximum height, new yarn is fed into the hook section of the needle, just above the closing element.
<br>4.Needle Descent:The needle begins to descend, and simultaneously, the closing element slides forward, closing the hook. This secures the new yarn.
<br>5.Loop Formation: As the needle continues descending, the old loop is pulled over the closed hook, which holds the new yarn. This forms a new loop from the new yarn.
<br>6.Reset: The needle returns to its original position, ready to repeat the process.
